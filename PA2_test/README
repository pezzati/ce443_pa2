To setup the test environment:
0. Change your current directory to the same directory containing this README.
	cd /path/to/here
1. Install dependencies:
	apt-get install tcpdump python-virtualenv
2. Setup the virtualenv:
	virtualenv -p /bin/python2 venv
3. Set required permissions for running binaries:
	sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip' venv/bin/python2
	sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip' `which tcpdump`
4. Activate the virtualenv:
	source venv/bin/activate
5. Install scapy:
	pip install scapy==2.3.1
6. Place your code in `PA1-cf` and compile it
7. Set these variables in `tester/config.json`:
	cf_path: absolute path to the `PA1-cf` directory containing your code
	iface: set this to the interface name that connects to Partov. You should find it by running `ifconfig` command. (e.g. eth0, wlan0)
8. Use "noc" as map name in info.sh.



To run the tests:
1. Activate the virtualenv:
	source venv/bin/activate
2. Run the evaluation script:
	`./run_tests.sh`
3. Results will be stored in the log folder and has the following structure:
	log/errors/method_name.log: Assertion errors that your code faced during running each test method. These logs could help you to debug your codes.
	pcaps/method_name.cap: captured packets during running each test scenario.



Please note that you can only run your own codes and have not access to true codes.
